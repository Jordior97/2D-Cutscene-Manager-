# 2D Cutscene Manager
This is my Personal Research about creating and managing 2D cutscenes

## INTRODUCTION
Before starting to program, let's talk about some introduction concepts.

### WHAT IS A CUTSCENE?

It’s a video sequence where the player doesn’t have the control (or it’s limited), and it has multiple functions:

-	Makes advance the plot.
- Presents new characters.
-	Provides crucial information (dialogues, clues, background information…).
-	And more.

These scenes are made by scheduled events, using often game graphics. 
They can also be animated, real images or previosly rendered images (and transmitted from a video file). 
These pre-made videos used in video games are called “Full Motion Videos” (FMVs).

### TYPES OF CUTSCENES

**1) Live-Action Cutscenes:**

Similar to films, they use actors, real scenarios, cameras... to create scenographies that  will be introduced into the game.
Due to this, Interactive Films were created (hours of real action footage, without the characteristic interactivity and complexity of the games).

**2) Animated Cutscenes:**
- **Pre-rendered scenes**

The developers animate and render these scenes, and they take advantages of the compter generated image, 
traditional animation or graphic novel techniques.

This type of scenes has two notable problems:
1.	Quality difference can create difficulties for the recognition of the game (the player used to play with low-quality graphics) and this can break the flow of the game.
2.	They can’t be adapted to the game state (clothes, etc.).

- **Real Time Cutscenes**

Rendered using the same game engine as the graphics during the gameplay. It’s known as *Machinima*.

*Comparison with Live–Action Cutscenes:*
- Lower detail.
- Adaptation to the game state.
- Player can control the camera movement.

**3) Interactive Cutscenes:**

Player can take the control of the character doing some indicated actions ( pressing  a buttons sequence, for exaple) 
shown on the screen. 
He must follow these instructions in order to continue the game.
This mechanic is commonly called *quick time events*.
